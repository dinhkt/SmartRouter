This purpose of this project is to help mobile devices connect automatically to the closest router to them in case they move away from the original router. In fact, router typically has a special mode called "promiscuous mode" which allows router to capture every packet around it. What we do in this project is modifying the OpenWrt firmware of the router to sniff packets from the target device to get information about the strength signal of the target device toward the router.Then,the infomation is sent to another router, which acts as a server router. Base on strength signals come from the client routers, the server decides whether the device should reconnect to the more closer router to it or not. If yes,it sends request to the router which is currently connected to the device to disconnect to the device for a while. The device then automatically find the nearest router to get connect again.
